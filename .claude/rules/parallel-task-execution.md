# Parallel Task Execution

**When a plan identifies independent steps, always run them as parallel background tasks** to maximize throughput and minimize wall-clock time.

After the exploration phase:

1. **Review the plan's parallelization markers** — the plan must indicate which steps can run independently
2. **Spawn background agents** (`run_in_background: true`) for each independent step, using worktree isolation (`isolation: "worktree"`) when they touch different files
3. **Run dependent steps sequentially** — only block on steps that have explicit dependencies on prior results
4. **Merge results** once all background tasks complete

The main agent should act as an orchestrator: dispatch parallel work, monitor completion, and only perform sequential steps itself.
