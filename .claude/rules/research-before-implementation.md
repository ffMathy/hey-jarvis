# Research Before Implementation

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS perform web searches before starting any task.**

## Mandatory Protocol

Before implementing ANY feature, you MUST:

1. Perform **at minimum 1 web search** (more is better)
2. Search for:
   - Current best practices and patterns
   - Latest library versions and APIs
   - Security considerations and common pitfalls
   - Existing solutions and examples
   - Documentation and tutorials

## When to Search

✅ **ALWAYS search before:**
- Implementing any new feature
- Choosing a library or dependency
- Making architectural decisions
- Writing complex algorithms
- Working with unfamiliar APIs or frameworks
- Encountering errors or issues
- Being uncertain about best practices

## Example Research Flow

```
// STEP 1: Research (REQUIRED)
Search: "TypeScript async error handling best practices 2024"
Search: "best SQLite libraries for Node.js TypeScript 2024"
Search: "SQL injection prevention TypeScript parameterized queries"

// STEP 2: Implement based on research
// ... your implementation here
```

## Search Tool
Use your preferred search engine (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.) and consider using advanced search operators to narrow down results. Always check the date of the information to ensure it's current.

**Remember**: More research = Better implementation. Never skip this step!
