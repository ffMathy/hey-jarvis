# Jarvis Mastra AI Agents

## Overview
This project is a Mastra-powered AI agent framework that enables intelligent home automation, voice interactions, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations within the Hey Jarvis ecosystem.

## About Mastra
[Mastra](https://mastra.ai) is a TypeScript agent framework designed to build production-ready AI applications. It provides unified interfaces for multiple LLM providers, persistent agent memory, tool calling capabilities, and graph-based workflows.

## Project Structure
The project follows Mastra's recommended structure:

## Key Features

### ü§ñ Intelligent Agents
- **TypeScript-based agents** with persistent memory and tool calling
- **Multi-provider LLM support** via Vercel AI SDK (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini)
- **Structured output** generation with Zod validation
- **Real-time streaming** responses with step-by-step visibility

### üîß Tool Ecosystem
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server integrations
- **Home automation tools** for smart device control
- **Voice processing** capabilities for speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- **External API integrations** for weather, calendar, and more

### üåä Workflow Engine
- **Graph-based workflows** with deterministic execution
- **Branching and conditional logic** with `.then()`, `.branch()`, `.parallel()`
- **Suspend/resume functionality** for human-in-the-loop interactions
- **Real-time tracing** and observability

### üß† Memory & Context
- **Persistent agent memory** with semantic recall
- **Thread-based conversations** with context preservation
- **Vector database integration** for knowledge retrieval
- **Working memory** for short-term context management

## Current Agents

### Weather Agent
Provides intelligent weather information and forecasting capabilities:
- **4 OpenWeatherMap tools**: Current weather and 5-day forecasts by city name or GPS coordinates
- **Google Gemini model**: Uses `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` for natural language processing
- **Smart defaults**: Automatically assumes Aarhus, Denmark when no location is specified
- **Never asks questions**: Makes best-guess assumptions for seamless interaction
- **Persistent memory**: Maintains conversation context with LibSQLStore
- **Scheduled monitoring**: Hourly weather checks with automatic memory updates

**Converted from n8n**: This agent replicates the exact functionality of the original n8n Weather Agent workflow, including the same system message, tools, and behavior patterns.

*Note: Additional agents will be added as the project evolves.*

## Available Workflows

### Weather Workflow
Multi-step weather processing workflow with two main components:
- **`weatherWorkflow`**: Handles interactive weather requests from prompts or chat (replaces n8n ExecuteWorkflowTrigger + ChatTrigger)
- **`weatherMonitoringWorkflow`**: Performs scheduled weather checks every hour with memory updates (replaces n8n ScheduleTrigger chain)
- **Agent integration**: Seamlessly connects to the weather agent for tool execution
- **Memory updates**: Automatically notifies other agents when weather conditions change

## Development

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Mastra globally
npm install mastra --global
```

### Running the Project
```bash
# Start development server with playground
npx nx serve jarvis-mcp

# Build for production
npx nx build jarvis-mcp
```

### Development Playground
Access the Mastra development playground at `http://localhost:4111/agents` to:
- Test agents interactively
- Monitor agent memory and state
- Debug tool calls and workflows
- View execution traces and performance metrics

### Environment Setup

This project uses **1Password CLI** for secure environment variable management in both development and production environments. 

#### Development Setup
1. **Install 1Password CLI**: Follow [1Password CLI installation guide](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/)
2. **Sign in to 1Password**: `op signin`
3. **Store your API keys** in 1Password vaults with the paths referenced in `.env`
4. **Run commands**: Use `nx serve jarvis-mcp` or `nx run jarvis-mcp:mcp` - both use `op run` automatically

#### Important Development Guidelines
- **Do NOT create separate `*-dev` targets** that bypass 1Password CLI
- **The `op run` approach is designed for both development AND production**
- **1Password CLI provides secure local testing** without hardcoded keys
- **All nx targets should use the same `op run --env-file=".env"` pattern**
- **This ensures consistency between development and deployment environments**

If you encounter 1Password CLI authentication issues:
1. Run `op signin` to authenticate
2. Verify your vault contains the referenced secret paths
3. Check that the `.env` file references match your 1Password structure

## Development Guidelines

### File Creation Policy
**IMPORTANT**: When working on this project:
- **Do NOT create new README files** unless explicitly requested
- **Do NOT create new example scripts or test files** unless explicitly requested  
- **Do NOT create testing scripts** - use existing documentation and the Mastra playground instead
- **Do NOT create analysis files** like `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`, `COMPARISON.md`, or similar documentation artifacts
- **Do NOT create temporary documentation files** for explanations - use inline comments or update existing docs
- **Only modify existing documentation and examples** when making changes
- **Focus on core functionality** (agents, tools, workflows) rather than documentation artifacts

### Build and Development Commands
**CRITICAL: ALWAYS use NX commands** for this monorepo:
- ‚úÖ Use `nx serve jarvis-mcp` instead of `npm run dev`
- ‚úÖ Use `nx build jarvis-mcp` instead of `npm run build` 
- ‚úÖ Use `nx test jarvis-mcp` instead of `npm run test`
- ‚úÖ Use `nx lint jarvis-mcp` instead of `npm run lint`
- ‚úÖ Use `npx nx install` for package installations through NX
- ‚ùå **NEVER use `npm run` commands** in this NX monorepo
- ‚ùå **NEVER use `npm install` directly** - use NX workspace commands
- ‚ùå **NEVER use `npm start`, `npm test`, `npm build`** - always prefix with `nx`

**Why NX is Required:**
- NX provides intelligent caching and dependency management
- Ensures consistent builds across the monorepo
- Manages project dependencies and task orchestration
- Prevents conflicts between different project configurations

### Agent Architecture Guidelines
When refactoring or creating agents:
- **Prefer specialized agents** over single multi-purpose agents for complex workflows
- **Keep agent prompts focused** on specific cognitive tasks
- **Use clear separation of concerns** between search, selection, generation, and formatting
- **Maintain backward compatibility** by keeping original agent names as aliases
- **Update the main Mastra index** to register all new specialized agents
- **Test agent interactions** using the Mastra playground at `http://localhost:4111/agents`

This keeps the project lean, properly structured, and aligned with NX monorepo best practices.
