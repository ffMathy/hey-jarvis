# Jarvis MCP Agents

## Overview
This document describes the agents and automation capabilities for the Jarvis MCP (Model Context Protocol) project in the Hey Jarvis monorepo.

## Project Description
A simple Hello World TypeScript application that demonstrates basic MCP server structure and serves as a foundation for future Model Context Protocol integrations and AI agent capabilities.

## Key Features
- Simple TypeScript-based "Hello World" MCP application
- Demonstrates basic class structure and method execution
- Foundation for AI agent communication and tool integration
- Extensible architecture for future MCP protocol implementation

## Agents & Automation
Currently implements:
- **HelloWorldMCP**: A basic MCP agent that demonstrates greeting functionality
- Simple logging and execution flow
- Foundation for tool registration and execution

## Future Capabilities
- Full Model Context Protocol server implementation
- AI tool registration and management
- Integration with language models and AI services
- Cross-agent communication protocols
- Home automation tool integration
- Voice command processing integration

## MCP Protocol Support
Designed to support:
- Tool registration and discovery
- Secure agent communication
- Resource management
- Error handling and logging
- Real-time agent coordination

## Usage
```bash
# Build the MCP server
npx nx build jarvis-mcp

# Run the MCP server
npx nx serve jarvis-mcp
```

## Development
The MCP server is built using TypeScript and follows NX monorepo conventions. All source code is located in the `src/` directory. The application is designed to be easily extensible for future MCP protocol implementation.
