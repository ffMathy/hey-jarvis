# Mastra Studio Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots captured during Playwright e2e tests and manual testing of the Mastra Studio UI.

## Automated Screenshots

The following screenshots are automatically generated by running `bunx playwright test`:

- `studio-homepage.png` - Studio UI homepage
- `studio-agents.png` - Agents page with list of available agents
- `studio-workflows.png` - Workflows page with workflow visualization
- `studio-api-status.png` - API connection status verification
- `swagger-ui.png` - Swagger UI for API documentation

## Manual Testing Screenshots

For manual testing and documentation purposes, capture screenshots showing:

1. **Agent Interaction**: Chat interface with an agent responding to queries
2. **Workflow Execution**: Step-by-step workflow execution with visual progress
3. **Tool Testing**: Individual tool execution with input/output
4. **Observability**: Traces and logs for debugging
5. **Scorers**: Evaluation results and performance metrics

## Capturing Screenshots
