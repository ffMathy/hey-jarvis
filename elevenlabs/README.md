# ElevenLabs Integration

End-to-end testing suite and conversational agent configuration for integrating Jarvis with ElevenLabs' voice AI platform.

## Overview

This project contains comprehensive testing frameworks, documentation, and configuration templates for setting up Jarvis as a conversational agent within ElevenLabs. It serves as the voice interface layer that connects users to the intelligent capabilities provided by the Jarvis MCP server.

## Features

- **Voice Interface Testing**: Automated end-to-end tests for voice interactions
- **Conversational Agent Prompts**: Optimized prompts and instructions for ElevenLabs agents
- **Integration Documentation**: Step-by-step guides for connecting ElevenLabs to Jarvis MCP
- **Quality Assurance**: Voice quality and response accuracy validation tools

## Contents

- `prompt.txt` - Core conversational agent prompt for ElevenLabs configuration
- Test suites for voice interaction scenarios
- Documentation for ElevenLabs API integration
- Configuration templates for different voice models

## Setup

1. Configure your ElevenLabs API credentials
2. Deploy the Jarvis MCP server (see `../jarvis-mcp/README.md`)
3. Import the conversational agent prompt into your ElevenLabs workspace
4. Run integration tests to verify connectivity

## Usage

This project is primarily used for:
- Setting up new ElevenLabs conversational agents with Jarvis capabilities
- Testing voice interaction flows before production deployment
- Validating MCP server connectivity and tool functionality
- Quality assurance for voice response accuracy and latency

## Integration

The ElevenLabs agent configured through this project will communicate with:
- **Jarvis MCP Server** (`../jarvis-mcp`) for intelligent tool execution
- **Home Assistant** (via the addon) for home automation control
- **Voice Hardware** (via firmware) for local processing capabilities
